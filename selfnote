shift arrow key work but not alt arrow key... somehow


→ this does work. Just not in terminator. Mainly because it conflict with termantior's shortcut key.


`setw -g mouse off`  => give you back the mouse based copy and paste.  

→ but then we lose the ability to scroll the screen.

just do ctrl+b , [.   Then you can use page-up and page-down key. 
To exit, simply type ‘q’
⇒ this is basically a vi mode command!
=> to search, simply hit '/' key. press 'n' to jump to next searched result.  
=> Right hand top corner will show the number of result found.
⇒ you can't do with mouse.. but it is good the less you use mouse and more with keyboard.

[pasting from clipboard]:
press "i" key in vi, then do ctrl + shift + v.  you can then paste from non-tmux clipboard to the terminal.  
-> or you can simply use nano instead of vi, which right click will work...
